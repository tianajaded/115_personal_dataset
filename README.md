#Seattle Demographics
 ##Motivation
I have lived off and on in Seattle for my whole life and love the city. I have seen it really change over the course of growing up here, and I want to look a little bit closer at some of the data. As a black person, I was definitely curious about some of the racial demographics and wanted to look into them further. And from there, I just kept having more and more questions, which is what this dataset has set out to examine and answer. 

##Data Sources
All of the data I got from the US Census Bureau, The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the American Community Survey. 

I will analyze and go through the processing steps of each visualization. 


###Race and Education
This visualization is the amount of bachelor's degrees in Seattle, Washington seperated by race and colored by the year. As you can see, this one has some pretty big outliers. This is a good example of when you want to really think about the outliers in your EDA. In this case, you wouldn't want to remove these outliers because they are obviously very relevant. The amount of degrees awarded to white students far outshadows those given to any other race. This made me wonder why this is. Is it because colleges are purposely being racist? Well not exactly. This is most likely because there are a lot less non-white students in Seattle in the first place. According to the 2000 US Census, the population of black people in seattle was 7%, 14% Asian, 65% white, .4% Native American, .9% Pacific Islander, 2.3% from other races, and 5.6% multiracial. With that context, white students being a large outlier makes sense.
